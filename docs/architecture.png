This file should be a PNG diagram showing the FlowCraft architecture.

The diagram should visualize:
1. API Server component
2. Worker component
3. Redis Queue
4. PostgreSQL Database
5. Workflow Engine
6. Node Executors
7. The data flow between components

You'll need to create this diagram using a drawing tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagram tool
and save it as architecture.png in the docs folder.
